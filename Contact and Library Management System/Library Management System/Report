📚 School Library Management System
This is a simple console-based Library Management System built in C++. It allows basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student library accounts. The data is stored using binary file handling.

🛠 Features
Add a new account

View all existing accounts

Search for an account by account number

Edit details of an existing account

Delete an account

Persistent storage via details.txt file

🗂 Structure
Each Library Account contains:

Account number (string)

Name (char array)

Book name (char array)

Status (char array)

🧾 Usage
🧵 Menu Options
Once you run the program, the following menu is displayed:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Press 0 to exit
Press 1 to add new account
Press 2 to display all accounts
Press 3 to search for an account
Press 4 to edit an existing account
Press 5 to delete an existing account
📥 Input Format
When prompted:

Enter strings for account number, name, book name, and status (e.g., issued, available, etc.)

💾 File Handling
Data is stored in a binary file called details.txt.

A temporary file temp.txt is used while deleting an account.

Data is read and written using C++'s fstream.

🧪 Example
yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter the account number: 1001
Enter the name: Alice
Enter the book's name: DataStructures
Enter the status: issued
⚠️ Limitations
Uses C-style character arrays (char[]) instead of modern std::string for names and status.

No input validation or error handling for file operations.

Assumes fixed input sizes and uses unsafe casting (char*)&object.

📌 How to Compile and Run
Use any C++ compiler like g++:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o library_system library_system.cpp
./library_system
📘 Future Improvements
Switch to using std::string for all textual data.

Add user authentication for admin access.

Improve file I/O safety and adopt modern C++ practices.

Implement due date and fine calculations.

GUI version using frameworks like Qt or CLI frameworks like ncurses.
